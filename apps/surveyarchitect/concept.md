# UI/UX Concept for the Survey Editor and Exportable Survey HTMLs

This concept outlines the design principles, user flows, and visual guidelines for two core parts of the project:

1. **The Survey Editor Application:** An intuitive, drag‐and‐drop, Vue.js 3–powered interface that allows survey designers to create, configure, and preview scientific surveys.
2. **The Exportable Survey HTML Files:** A fully standalone, responsive, and accessible survey form that includes an embedded Vue instance, branching logic, internationalization support, and a consistent look and feel with the editor.

## 1. Overall Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity & Clarity:**  
  Both the editor and the exported survey should be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate. Clear typography, intuitive icons, and ample white space help reduce cognitive load.
  
- **Consistency:**  
  Visual consistency between the editor and the exported survey helps build trust. Consistent use of colors, fonts, button styles, and layout ensures that users recognize the final product as a natural extension of their design experience.

- **Responsiveness & Accessibility:**  
  Design for multiple devices and ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are met. The UI should adapt to various screen sizes, support keyboard navigation, and provide sufficient contrast.

- **Customization & Flexibility:**  
  Enable users to personalize survey themes (colors, fonts, and spacing) and layout, both in the editor and in the exported HTML. Designers should be able to preview changes in real time.

## 2. Survey Editor UI/UX

### 2.1. Landing & Dashboard

- **Welcome Screen:**  
  A clean landing page introduces the tool with a short tagline (e.g., “Design and Export Your Scientific Survey with Ease”) along with clear calls-to-action such as “Create New Survey” or “Load Existing Survey.”
  
- **Dashboard View:**  
  Once inside the editor, users see a split-screen layout:
  - **Left Panel (Sidebar):** Contains a toolbar for adding question types, configuring settings (e.g., branching rules, randomization, internationalization), and managing translations.
  - **Central Canvas:** A drag–and–drop workspace where survey elements are arranged. Each survey question appears as a card with quick-access buttons for editing, duplicating, or removing.
  - **Right Panel (Live Preview):** Shows a real-time, read-only preview of how the final survey will render on a typical device.

### 2.2. Editor Controls and Interactions

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**  
  Users can add questions from the toolbar into the canvas. They reorder questions with smooth drag animations. The card UI displays minimal but essential details (e.g., question text, type icon).

- **Inline Editing & Quick Actions:**  
  Clicking on a question card expands it into an editable form. In-place editing (for question text, options, and translations) minimizes modal pop-ups. Action buttons (like “Edit Logic” or “Preview”) are clearly labeled and use recognizable icons.

- **Sidebar Tools:**  
  - **Branching & Logic Editor:** A dedicated section allows users to set up conditional rules with a simple “if–then” interface. A visual flow diagram may help illustrate complex logic.
  - **Translation Manager:** A tabbed interface lists languages; users can switch tabs to input translations for each question and option. Visual cues (such as a “flag” icon) indicate the current language.

- **Real-Time Feedback:**  
  Immediate visual confirmation when changes are saved. Use subtle animations (e.g., fading highlights) to indicate that updates are reflected in the preview. Errors or missing translations are flagged with inline messages.

- **Global Controls:**  
  The header of the editor includes options to save work, export the survey, and switch between editing and preview modes. A persistent “Export Survey” button is always visible.

### 2.3. Visual Design

- **Color Palette & Typography:**  
  Use a neutral, professional palette with accent colors to highlight active elements (such as buttons and selected items). Sans-serif fonts ensure clarity and readability.
  
- **Icons & Imagery:**  
  Icons should be modern, simple, and representative of their function (e.g., a pencil for edit, a trash can for delete). Images and illustrations are minimal to keep the focus on the content.

- **Layout & Spacing:**  
  Use a grid system to ensure consistency. Adequate padding and margin around interactive elements reduce clutter and help guide the user’s eye.

## 3. Exportable Survey HTML UI/UX

### 3.1. Standalone Survey Form Design

- **Clean and Minimal Layout:**  
  The exported survey should reflect the same visual language as the editor. It should present a single-column form with clear labels, ample spacing, and a logical flow of questions.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  The survey form adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. For mobile devices, touch-friendly buttons, large input fields, and vertical stacking ensure a smooth experience.

- **Language Selector:**  
  At the top of the survey, include a simple dropdown or a set of flag icons that allow respondents to switch languages. The UI should update immediately based on selection.

### 3.2. Interactive Elements

- **Question Rendering:**  
  Each question type has a distinct UI:
  - **Multiple Choice:** Radio buttons or checkboxes with clear labels.
  - **Likert Scales:** Clearly marked scales with tooltips or labels for each end (e.g., “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”).
  - **Open Text & File Uploads:** Intuitive input fields with placeholder text and, where applicable, file selection buttons.
  
- **Branching & Navigation:**  
  As respondents answer, branching logic dynamically shows or hides questions. Transitions should be smooth, with no jarring changes. Consider a subtle slide or fade effect to indicate that the question flow is changing.

- **Progress Indicators:**  
  A progress bar or step counter helps respondents understand how far they are in the survey. This encourages completion, especially in longer surveys.

### 3.3. Accessibility and Usability

- **Accessible Forms:**  
  Ensure that form fields have associated labels and proper ARIA attributes. Inputs must be reachable by keyboard, and focus states should be highly visible.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Inline validation for required fields and proper error messages should guide users if they submit incomplete or incorrect information.
  
- **Offline & Lightweight Performance:**  
  Since the exported HTML is standalone, it must load quickly even without network connectivity. Optimize scripts and styles to ensure a smooth, lag-free experience.

### 3.4. Visual Consistency with the Editor

- **Matching Themes:**  
  The exported survey should offer a “what you see is what you get” experience. Options chosen in the editor (such as color schemes and fonts) should be reflected in the exported file.
  
- **Branding Options:**  
  Allow survey designers to add a custom logo or header in the editor. This branding should appear in the exported survey to give it a professional, personalized look.

## 4. User Flows

### 4.1. Survey Creation Flow

1. **Initiation:**  
   User lands on the dashboard and selects “Create New Survey.”
2. **Design Phase:**  
   The user drags question types into the canvas, edits text, sets up branching logic, and inputs translations.
3. **Live Preview:**  
   Simultaneously, the preview pane updates, reflecting the current survey layout and interactive elements.
4. **Export:**  
   Once satisfied, the user clicks “Export Survey,” which compiles the configuration into a standalone HTML file that is immediately available for download.

### 4.2. Survey Respondent Flow (Exported HTML)

1. **Entry Point:**  
   The respondent opens the HTML file and is greeted by a clean, branded survey landing page.
2. **Language Selection:**  
   At the top, a language selector allows the user to choose their preferred language.
3. **Survey Interaction:**  
   The respondent answers questions sequentially. Branching logic adapts the form in real time.
4. **Submission & Feedback:**  
   Upon completion, the respondent submits the form. The UI provides immediate confirmation, and optional client-side validation ensures that all required fields are completed.

## 5. Final Considerations

- **Consistency Across Platforms:**  
  Ensure that the visual style, interactive behaviors, and branding remain consistent regardless of whether the user is in the editor or using the exported survey.
  
- **User Testing:**  
  Conduct usability testing sessions with both survey designers and respondents. Gather feedback on ease of use, clarity of the interface, and overall experience to iterate on the design.

- **Documentation & Help:**  
  Provide tooltips, inline help, and a dedicated documentation section within the editor to assist users in understanding how to use features like branching logic and translation management.

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Both the editor and the exported survey should be optimized for fast load times. Use lazy-loading, minimize script size, and ensure that CSS is optimized for quick rendering.
